x Implement config fetching code
x Debug and test the config system with training and inference


x Make Trainer and Inferer take into account the input_modality / input_representation while fetching input patches

- Implement validation metrics:
    x Dice and Jaccard for now. 
    - Then Surface Dice

- Implement and test Dice loss

- Improve WandB logging:
    - Log system-related stuff 
    - Log richer info - prediction, etc.


- Efficiency improvement:
    - torch.cuda.empty_cache() -- read more about this
    - Option for distributed training: See torch DataParallel for now. Later move on to using torch DistributedDataParallel
