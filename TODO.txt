- Add an option of outputting attention maps in MSAM3D; make changes in Trainer and Inferer 

- Simplify MSAM (maybe):
    - Reduce out_channels_first of attention module from 32 to 16 or to 8


- Implement validation metrics:
    x Dice and Jaccard for now. 
    - Then Surface Dice


- Improve WandB logging:
    x Different logging steps for training and validation
    x Log system-related stuff 
    - Log richer info - prediction, etc.


- Efficiency improvement:
    - torch.cuda.empty_cache() -- read more about this
    - Option for distributed training: See torch DataParallel for now. Later move on to using torch DistributedDataParallel 

- Integrate enable_distributed option of the Trainer and Infer into the config system
