x Integrate patch aggregation and use for dice metric calculation for validation
 
- Implement validation metrics, use only on aggregated prediction volumes:
    x Dice and Jaccard for now. 
    - Then Surface Dice

x Use WandB for logging. Then run the training script tests.
- Improve WandB logging:
    - Log system-related stuff 
    - Log richer info - prediction, etc.

- Build temp inference script that includes saving the predictions as NRRD

- Efficiency improvement:
    - torch.cuda.empty_cache() -- read more about this
    - Option for distributed training: See torch DataParallel for now. Later move on to using torch DistributedDataParallel 




- Reorganize code
    - YAML config files
    - Trainer and Inferer classes
